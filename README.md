<p style="font-size=18px"><strong> Molecular Anatomy Protocol </strong> </p>
<p> 
These protocols allow to generate molecular frameworks for a compound dataset according to the definition rules identifying a set of nine molecular representations at different abstraction levels, combined with fragmentation rules, to define a multi-dimensional network of hierarchically interconnected molecular frameworks. The protocols generate also the files use for the network visualization that allows a full graphical representation compounds dataset, permitting an efficient navigation in the scaffoldâ€™s space and significantly contributing to perform high quality SAR analysis.
