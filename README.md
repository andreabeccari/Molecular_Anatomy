<p style="font-size=18px"><strong> Molecular Anatomy Pipeline Protocol </strong> </p>
<p> 
This Pipeline Pilot protocol allows to generate molecular frameworks according to the definition rules identifying a set of nine molecular representations at different abstraction levels, combined with fragmentation rules, to define a multi-dimensional network of hierarchically interconnected molecular frameworks. The protocol prepare also the files for a network visualization that allows a full graphical representation compounds dataset, permitting an efficient navigation in the scaffoldâ€™s space and significantly contributing to perform high quality SAR analysis.
